#summary Getting started with the Itemscript library using JavaScript.
#labels Featured

The Itemscript library exposes only a few methods to JavaScript; most of those used for manipulating JSON values aren't particularly useful in JavaScript, where native JavaScript objects and values are more useful.

==Include the Itemscript library==

Inside the itemscript-javascript-x.x.x.zip archive is a directory called `org.itemscript.Itemscript`. Copy this directory and its contents to the same directory as your HTML file.

Then include the script file with a line like this:
{{{
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript"
        src="org.itemscript.Itemscript/org.itemscript.Itemscript.nocache.js"></script>
}}}

==The Itemscript API for JavaScript==

These are the functions made available in JavaScript by the library:

  * `itemscript.get`
  * `itemscript.getAsync`
  * `itemscript.put`
  * `itemscript.putAsync`
  * `itemscript.remove`
  * `itemscript.removeAsync`
  * `itemscript.copy`
  * `itemscript.copyAsync`

The versions suffixed with "Async" operate asychronously; unless you know that the call will return immediately (e.g. that it is to a `mem:` or `cookie:` URL) the Async versions are probably the ones you need to use, as any attempt to store or retrieve using HTTP must be performed asynchronously.

==`itemscript.get`==

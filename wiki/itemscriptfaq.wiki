=What is Itemscript?=

The *Itemscript project* intends to provide a set of technologies and standard conventions for building applications from Itemscript components. 

*Itemscript* is a declarative provisioning language for JSON data.  Itemscript gives [http://json.org/ JSON] a language for expressing data, metadata, and applications. 

Itemscript expresses design independent of technical implementation. Interfaces and the services that power them can iterate independently to improve agility and reduce time to solution.

= Frequently Asked Questions =

==Why use JSON instead of XML?  Wasn't XML designed to do this?==

*XML* (eXtensible Markup Language) developed as a simplified expression of *SGML* (Standard Generalized Markup Language).  XML has gained wide adoption as a document interchange standard.  It was not designed as an application provisioning language though, and does not present a friendly interface to humans (except when you hide it from them).  

XML parsing is an expensive overhead to *AJAX* style applications.  *JSON* was designed to work with Javascript.  Torn between the nested elegance of XML and the pedal to the metal feel of JSON, we decided to take the best of XML and apply it to JSON.  

JSON is easy to write and understand.  It lends itself to declarative programming, and it presents itself ready to go out of the tubes whether it's presenting or persisting data.  

We think it is an excellent transport for a declarative language that's understood by programmers, interface designers, browsers, column stores, relational databases and web services.  What's good for Javascript is good for all of us.

==What's needed to build applications using Itemscript?==

At its most basic level, Itemscript provides a schema definition for JSON data.  If your applications are already handling JSON, you can use Itemscript to add a schema to your data.  This documents your data.  You can use the Itemscript validator to control what's moving through the tubes.  

If you're building new applications, remodeling into AJAX style UIs, adding cloud services or building mashboards, the Itemscript JSON library provides a common API for Java and GWT development.

==Is this an all or nothing proposition?  What about my stuff that already works?==

An "Itemscript system" is one that uses some or all of these building blocks.   An Itemscript system can interact with any component or service that knows how to read or write JSON, especially over RESTful connections.

It's possible to consume SOAP to build an Itemscript payload.  It's possible to provision interfaces built with HTML using an Itemscript system.  In these use cases, Itemscript provides a layer of isolation between the declarative functionality of the service or component and its internal complexity.  In that context, Itemscript enables the UI and the services it consumes to iterate independently of each other.  

==What levels of use are available?==

===Level 0=== 

The lowest level of compliance is any system that uses JSON to marshall data from RESTful services and provision interfaces using Java or Javascript APIs.

A level 0 application might use no Itemscript technologies. It may simply connect to an Itemscript system or adopt an Itemscript schema without using any code.

Many existing systems that use JSON over REST are already available for integration.

===Level 1=== 

A level 1 itemscript system uses itemscript JSON libraries to process JSON values and expose JSON APIs either in Java or over a RESTful service.

If you have a system architecture that works for you, you can use itemscript to expose JSON APIs that wrap its technical details and expose controls using itemscript declarations.  

===Level 2=== 

A level 2 Itemscript system uses Itemscript schema to describe it's metadata.  It may also use the Itemscript protocol to persist items. 

At this level, the Itemscript schema provides data validation and the Itemscript library provides an in memory object model and a RESTful proxy for data sources.

===Level 3===

A level 3 Itemscript system uses an Itemscript object model to manage its internal workings. The application is entirely configured using JSON structures that are processed
by the Itemscript libraries.

At this level, the Itemscript system model may represent all your data as JSON structures. You are able to configure your application using JSON.  

At level 3, the Itemscript system mediates communication between different parts of your system using a shared data space and event model.  At this level, the components of your system communicate without directly linking to one another.  

==What are the benefits of using Itemscript?==

With Itemscript, your application is dynamically configurable, your interfaces are extremely extensible, and your components are hot swappable.  Your cost of ownership will be lower and your responsiveness to change will be higher.  

The Itemscript design exploits a loosely coupled architecture.  During  development, your datastores can be stubbed out to use simple services.  Your technical developers can  expose controls while hiding complexity.  

This allows a wider group of people to contribute to application development efforts. Casual programmers can read and write Itemscript.  

Instead of spending their time creating and compiling superficial variations of existing code, programmers can publish re-usable components that can be configured and connected using simple declarative statements, expressed in JSON.

Instead of changing code to remodel an interface, or generating new code to re-use a component, your interface developers will be composing from re-usable components.

==What are the pieces and parts of itemscript?==

===Itemscript JSON library=== 

This is a Java library for working with JSON data.  It's designed to provide convenient services to JSON objects.  JsonObject type implements Map. There are convenience methods for null-safe conversion of stored values to native Java types. There are methods for
easily creating sub-objects, and for accessing deeply-nested values by path.

This library is compatible with a conventional Java stack (for instance, web applications on an application server).  We developed it using Google's GWT, which compiles Java to concise Javascript for use in web browsers. 

For advanced users, this library provides a sophisticated in-memory data model.  You can include connections to external persistent data sources or stores. You can attach event handlers to values.  This enables a loosely coupled relationship between the parts of your system mediated through the Itemscript data model. 

You can even attach native Java values to parts of the data model. Many of the kinds of things you might do with a dependency-injection framework or JNDI can be done using itemscript declarations.

===Itemscript Schema specification===

[http://itemscript.org/ItemscriptSchema.html Itemscript schema language] is a simple standard way to describe JSON data. It aims to be a
human-readable, human-writable way to share the contents of a JSON structure.  In a loosely typed environment, it can also be used to validate data and catch errors.

Any schema language intends to support human-to-human communication. Domain experts should not need to be experts in a schema language to communicate their
understanding of the structure and content of shared information.

===Itemscript Schema library===

This is a Java library that works with an Itemscript Schema specification.  It can read and  manipulate a schema, then validate JSON values or documents. There are simple methods that check values and throw errors or return lists of errors.  You can use this library to return
annotated JSON structures with embedded type metadata.

===Itemscript Messages library=== 

This library allows for simple internationalization and localization of messages, including interpolation of parameter values, using message files defined in JSON.

===Itemscript Persistence Protocol specification===

We define a simple protocol using JSON over REST that allows for create, read, update, delete, and list operations, and specifies what will be returned for success, errors, and warnings. You can use this specification to connect disparate data sources via standard Itemscript declarations

===Itemscript Persistence Protocol library for Java & GWT===

This library helps you work with Itemscript CRUD Protocol exchanges, whether on the initiating or receiving side. With GWT, it lets you easily retrieve or store data without getting into the details of assembling HTTP requests.

===Itemscript Pages library for GWT===

This library helps GWT applications maintain state, respond correctly to the back button, and set bookmarks. It uses the metaphor of pages, including multiple pages in tabs or panels, to control how an application animates information in response to user
requests or responses from a server.

===Itemscript Authentication & Authorization library for Java & GWT===

Almost all applications require authentication and authorization. This library defines the conventions for obtaining and managing authentication information.  It produces authentication tokens that can be passed to web clients. Within GWT, it
provides facilities for managing tokens in cookies, passing them back to servers. It also provides a simple widget for accepting logins.

You can configure the authentication source on the server side to talk to your system of choice. 

==How does Itemscript compare to YAML?==

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a great project that's very compatible with Itemscript, as it can read and emit standard JSON. YAML provides a way to serialize and
deserialize objects but it doesn't provide an in-memory object store or an event model.

==What if we want to connect SQL databases and other legacy data?==

It's pretty straightforward to write an adapter to a relational server. We're working on a tool that will connect to SQL databases using Itemscript declarations.

Relational databases are not going away.  Legacy data is not going away.  Messaging is not going away.  Itemscript hides the complexity of their technical details and makes it easier to mash disparate data into intelligent interfaces.
